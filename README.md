I'm sharing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization of the data from Spotify using Python - A Data Analysis Project performed in my journey into Data Analyst.

# Spotify Data Analysis Project
![Spotify_Label](https://github.com/rahulrajan15/Spotify-Data-Analysis-Project/assets/113009011/08be1025-c3e7-4cb7-874a-36e27cbb4650)

Spotify is a Swedish audio streaming and media services provider founded in April 2006. 
It is the world's largest music streaming service provider and has over 381 million monthly active users, which also includes 172 million paid subscribers.

Here, l have explored and quantified data about music and drawn valuable insights.
Conducted data cleaning to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization of the Spotify dataset using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn).
Data analysis - Exploring the relationship between the audio features of a song and how positive or negative its lyrics are, involving sentiment analysisand manyuy more.
Spotify Data Analysis makes use of secondary data from Spotify. Use data to identify patterns and relationships between different characteristics. The activity will support in developing ability to review and interpret a dataset.
